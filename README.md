# Exercise to test the context API of React

## General Features

This project was created using Vite and uses the dependency "Prop-types" for props checking

The main objective is to create a context that keeps track of a counter and then updates its value on every click of the button. The idea is to prove that all the components of the app have access to the context providing these components are children of the context provider

## Context reference

## Instructions
